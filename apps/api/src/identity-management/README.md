# IDM connectivity and processing

This module incorporates the data retrieval from IDMs and its processing into the schulconnex data schema.

@todo: Add proper content!

## Fetchers

... t.b.d. ...

## Adapters

... t.b.d. ...

## Aggregator

... t.b.d. ...

## Filtration

... t.b.d. ...
**NOTE**:
The `pid` filtration is not performed with the request towards an IDM
but instead afterward on the fetched data due to the circumstance,
that the `pid` the client provides is a pseudonymized version of the original `pid`.
